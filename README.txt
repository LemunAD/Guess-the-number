This is a small scale game made in python v.3.10.8
The purpose of the game is to guess the exact number in X number of tries
The tries varying depending on the difficulty level
The game also registers the player's name and number of attempts they make before guessing the number
This also happens to be my first ever README file so I might be bad at it lmao
